## Introduction

Traffic sign recognition is one of the features of the modern assisted control system used on a motor vehicle. To correctly recognize a traffic sign is vital for driving safety. We will build a deep learning neural network, specifically convolutional neural network (CNN), to identify the traffic sign images.

## Dataset

This is an image classification task and originated from Kaggle, so traffic signs are all in image form. Note that the dataset size is quite large, so one can find the dataset on [Kaggle here](https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign).
